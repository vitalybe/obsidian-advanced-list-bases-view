## Basic map

Click **Map** in the top left corner of the base to configure view options. In the view configuration menu, open **Markers** to defined how markers are displayed. Markers use properties assigned to notes.

![[Places.base|Map]]

For example [[Eiffel Tower]] has the following properties:

| Property      | Value                    |                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `coordinates` | `48.85837`<br>`2.294481` | Coordinates are stored as `latitude, longitude`. You can get coordinates by right-clicking a location on the map and selecting **Copy coordinates**. |
| `icon`        | `landmark`               | The name of an icon from the [Lucide library](https://lucide.dev/).                                                                                  |
| `color`       | `red`                    | A valid CSS value: hex, RGB, named color, etc.                                                                                                       |

## Map with type-based markers

Instead of getting the icon and color from the note, we can also get them from the note's assigned type. In this example, [[Mus√©e d'Orsay]] is assigned the type [[Museums]]. To get the map marker from the Museum type we use [formula](https://help.obsidian.md/bases/functions) properties called **Type icon** and **Type color**:

```js
// Get the icon from the type
list(type)[0].asFile().properties.icon

// Get the color from the type
list(type)[0].asFile().properties.color
```

You can see these properties by selecting **Properties** at the top of the base toolbar.

## Related notes map

See the [[Museums]] note for an example of a map that only displays markers for its assigned type.
